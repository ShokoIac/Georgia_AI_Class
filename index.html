<h3> Hi, Iâ€™m Shoko â€” an optimist with a passion for people, purpose, and possibility.
With over 20 years of experience across hospitality and building operations, my journey has been anything but ordinary. Iâ€™ve spent a decade as an F&B Manager in the hospitality industry, where I learned the true value of service, connection, and the joy of creating memorable experiences. Then I shifted gears into the building and construction world, taking on the role of Operations Manager for another ten years. There, I discovered the beauty of structure â€” not just in buildings, but in teams, systems, and solutions.
Right now, Iâ€™m in a season of searching. Exploring. Listening. Iâ€™m not tied to one title or one path. Iâ€™m open â€” to new ideas, new challenges, and new ways to grow. My position? Still loadingâ€¦ and thatâ€™s part of the excitement.
At the heart of everything I do is a belief that every human deserves to be happy. Whether Iâ€™m leading a team, solving a problem, or simply sharing a cup of coffee with someone, I aim to bring warmth, clarity, and optimism into the moment. </h3>
